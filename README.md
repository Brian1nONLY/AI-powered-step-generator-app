# Steps Generator App

Instead of procrastinating on the work that you are supposed to do, what if a steps generator planned it all out for you?

## The Problem

Waste of time and productivity due to excessive planning or not knowing what to begin with

## The Solution

A AI-powered step generator application where users, by telling what they want to do, will get a detailed walkthrough for that task


## How it will work

- The user gives its input
- The app generates (from that input) a prompt to use Open AI
- The app calls the Open Ai APi with that input
- The app process the Open AI response and displays it to the user
