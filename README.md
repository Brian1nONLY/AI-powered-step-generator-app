## The Problem

Waste of time and productivity due to excessive planning or not knowing what to begin with

## The Solution

Using an AI-powered step generator application, users will get a detailed walkthrough for that task by telling the app what they want to do


## How it will work

- The user gives its input
- The app generates (from that input) a prompt to use Open AI
- The app calls the Open Ai APi with that input
- The app process the Open AI response and displays it to the user
